During the Microserices class on Dec. 14th 2023, we have experienced problems accessing the "product page" of the "bookshel" application in Istio. This problem is due to the combination of the Docker driver to run the 1.28.3 version of Kubernetes in Minikube (and is hopefully temporary. If you start a minikube cluster using another driver (on Ubuntu) it does work: minikube start --driver=kvm --memory=6G for instance. It also works as expected when using minikube on MacOS (tested on Intel): minikube --driver=vmware --memory=6G works also as expected. 

So the problem seems to be in the combination between minikube and the docker driver. Other solution might work as well, but you should try to avoid the VMware driver :-)

Many thanks to Mohammad T. for making this observation!
